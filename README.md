### Project Demo Link: [Index Cards App](https://jcsmileyjr.github.io/Index-Cards/)

### Purpose:
Online vocabulary test based on physical science and Mississippi studies high school subjects. The test is split into two types, multiple choice and a matching. 

### Motivation:
This is my child’s first year in high school and she is not adjusting well. I watched her dedicated many hours writing vocabulary terms and definitions on index cards to study for tests. Sometime she would lose the cards, damage them with food or water, get side tracked and lose her place, or not know if she have done well or not. 

I determine the solution is an online version of this simple but effective learning strategy. The greatest advantage is the use of her cell phone to study anywhere/anytime and none of the physical version disadvantages. 

### Objectives:
* The online test will allow multiple choice but have an option for a harder matching version.
* The online test would show a constant grade for feedback.
* The online test should show the correct answer if she chooses incorrectly.
* Bonus if the test can be reuse weeks later to study for final exams.

### Example of Use:
1.	Click on a test, either Multi-Choice or Fill in the Blank
2.	Read the question and choose an answer either from the radio buttons or select button. 

3.	Press the “Finish” button to confirm if the answer is correct.
4.	Press reviewing the results, press the “Done” button to continue to the next question. 
5.	When all questions is completed a final score is shown and user is taken back to the landing page.
